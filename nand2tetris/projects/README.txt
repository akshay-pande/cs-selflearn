This is my programming assignment submission for the first week in the Nand2Tetris course on Coursera:

Project 1: Elementary Logic Gates
Background
A typical computer architecture is based on a set of elementary logic gates like And, Or, Mux, etc., as well as their bit-wise versions And16, Or16, Mux16, etc. (assuming a 16-bit machine). This project engages you in the construction of a typical set of basic logic gates. These gates form the elementary building blocks from which more complex chips will be later constructed.

Objective
Build all the logic gates described in Chapter 1 (see list below), yielding a basic chip-set. The only building blocks that you can use in this project are primitive Nand gates and the composite gates that you will gradually build on top of them.
